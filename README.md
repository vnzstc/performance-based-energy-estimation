# Exploiting Performance Models for Energy Consumption Estimation
Measuring the energy consumption of software systems is complex since it depends on an untenable variety of factors, such as physical resources, scheduling algorithms, and the location of the devices. Therefore, it is hard to state the causes of high consumption values. Designers can cope with the complexity of energy analysis by using models describing only the most influential sources of consumption peaks. Performance models are a powerful tool for studying system performance, varying workloads, and resource demand. Such models approximate system behavior as a set of communicating resources consuming time. In this work, we exploit performance models to estimate energy consumption, which is proportional to resource utilization. This method would bring enormous benefits to system designers. For example, performance models could drive design energy optimization while observing the system undergoing different workloads.
